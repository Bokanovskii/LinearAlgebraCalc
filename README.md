# LinearAlgebraCalc
Calculator for Linear Algebra Operations

If you want to use the the calculator all you need to do is move the 
LinearAlgebraCalc executeable file out of the dist folder.

If you want to make changes to the code or view the implimentation the .py
files are provided.

This program is implimented in python and uses the built in tkinter library
in the design of its GUI.

The master script is named LinearAlgebraCalc.py and is where the GUI is built.
Matrices.py is where the code for the math lives and where the Matrix class is 
initialized. MatricesTests.py is a testing script for the math functions.

Happy computing!
